# Metrocar-Funnel_Analysis
SQL - Tableau

This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization. 
We will use SQL for data analysis and Tableau or Google Sheets for data visualization. 
The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel. 
Your task is to conduct a funnel analysis and present your analysis and recommendation. 
Explain your reason for your recommendation based on insights retrieved from the data.

Business questions

You will need to analyze the data and make recommendations based on the following business questions:

What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?
